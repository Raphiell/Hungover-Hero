Dev Log

First hour was picking ideas
Farming sim (wife's idea, loves stardew valley)
Pokemon style fighting game
Visual novel
Diablo 2 Clone
Doom Clone

I ended up with the doom clone
which unfortunately, is quite similar to a game miziziz made for one of his 4 devs jams

Second hour was preparing project. Getting assets in order and installing Qodot and setting up Trenchbroom to generate levels

After that was getting basic FPS controls

I also forgot to start the timer, but I took off how much I probably spent? Ugh, keeping track is more difficult then I thought.

Next is adding a weapon

Weapon is roughly added at 45:32 remaining

Onto an enemy!

Added basic enemies

Added enemy death

Added ladders

Improved movement (adding lerp and jump grace periods)

Nextup, HUD so you know your ammo and health

Added HUD for health
Added HUD for ammo

Forgot to start timer again, probably spent 40 min there? ugh, this sucks
I FUCKING EXITED THE TIMER TAB. FUCK
I think it was 42:59 remaining or something like that

 42:38 56 Finished adding crossbow shoot sound, will start timestamping these damn logs

 42:11 57 Started adding a pickup item, added sounds for arrows hitting stuff

 41:24 32 Finished pickup health and ammo, they have sounds too!

 40:23 22 Added health upgrade pickup, don't remember what else

 39:46 00 Began building actual level

 39:13 55 Stole a waves ambience sound from another one of my games, heh heh

 38:15 00 Just a lot of working on the level. Got the starting area ready

 37:45:00 Spent half of lunch at work drawing up a map for the game

 36:34 13 Sword added, weapon switching added

 35:51 12 Added connection to dungeon layer, jeez level building is tedious

 I fucking reloaded the page with the timer on it, instead of starting the level in godot. Fuck me

 Um. probably like...... 20 minutes? so  35:31 12
 
 34:45 56 Still working on the dungeon area. Plugging away

 34:07 20 Working on dungeon area some more, starting to add details

 34:06 38 Quickly moved around some pickups

 33:41 38 25 minutes at work finding sounds on freesounds.org

	Made some pickles from re-used bicks jars, very fitting

 33:05 49 Added a bunch of sounds, started adding buttons

 32:44 15 Finished adding buttons, added a door

 32:03 07 Finished adding doors for first little section, added player getting hit sound, knockback (need to increase it, add some y motion as well)

 30:43 34 Started adding first boss, realized I needed cutscenes first, so started working on that

 29:39 34 Basic cutscenes are working, just audio, no subtitles yet.
	I tried adding the font via a tileset and converting letters to tile ids, but I ended up just downloading a pixel font from the internet

 29:23 28 Cutscene system implemented! With text, audio, control locking, calling arbitrary methods, and waiting arbitrary amounts of time! love it.

 28:43 28 Started adding first boss cutscene, improved opening cutscene

 27:55 51 Polishing up the Boss cutscene, (actually just getting fricking rotation working) and hitting a snag on summoning the skeleton king

 26:24 54 Opening Cutscene, first Health Pot Cutscene, boss cutscene (outside of speech) complete!

Don't forget:
	Special scenario when you don't aggro the enemies
	Why do the shadows not work sometimes
	Fix jitter in player movement
	Add different sounds for different pickups

 25:53 31 Added boss death, and blue key door

 25:22 50 Added a sleeping man, fixed blue key door

 24:02 19 Added respawn and checkpoint system

 22:47 34 Skeleton Boss first attack type added

 20:39 42 Boss has 3 attack modes now, fight is really coming together

 20:00 38 Boss fight is mostly done for mechanics, just need audio now.

 18:27 25 Dungeon expansion underway

 18:15 00 More dungeon expansion

 17:54 12 Working in the car ride, added some pickups to the map, added upgraded sword texture and pickup

 17:23 13 Still in car, added skeleton spawner, regular skeletons drop stuff, added fireball turret

 17:04 41 Fixed skeleton spawner, seems to still randomly stop summoning? not sure

 15:55 11 Fixed some textures, added bits and bobs to map (pedestals), started adding draw bridge, torches

 15:38 14 Skeleton spawner not working sometimes seems to be some other object is getting the same id as the skeleton previously was, so the spawner still thinks there is an object there

 14:52 46 Tuneups galore, fixing various small things that have bugged me for a while. Trying to fix skele boss forcing himself into the last phase

 14:25 24 Fixed boss fight

 14:10 10 Added some decor tidbits, fixed boss door

 12:10 11 Added more functionality to the map, (ladders moving properly) added a tutorial, rerecorded voice lines

 10:52 21 Uhh, I can't quite recall what I've been doing this whole time. But I know I added god rays!

 10:40 46  Brother came to visit, so I got some valuable feedback, fireballs that follow you are too mean, maybe destroy/bounce them, giant pit with respawn system
encourages not jumping and grabbing ladder (but I think I'm fine with that)

 10:13 07 Made boss reset on death, made turrets only shoot straight-flying fireballs

 06:59 44 It's over. The last 3 hours have been a blur. Polishing this, fixing that, adding that important feature, forgetting this feature. It all blended together
but I did it, a game is uploaded. Then I had to reupload because the html version didn't capture the mouse. Oh well.

THINGS YOU WANT TO HIT WITH CROSSBOW GET PUT ON LAYER 2 AS WELL AS ANY OTHERS

ADD VINES
MARK BOSS ROOM DOOR
